## The User Experience (UX)
***

### Project purpose

To provide an application which makes you immediately think of Italy. This is a website for Italians, fans of Italian food and cuisine, and those who love to cook. They will be able to share recipes with others but also view what others have uploaded and continue to inspire their cooking. 

Italian food has developed over time and still remains to be one of the most popular dishes in the world - helped significantly by 'pizzas'! The brief of this project was to target those who love italian food, love to cook and need a place to store their recipes which is a site that is user friends and tailored to their wants/needs. <enter>

The following requirements were set at the beginning of the project:
* primary target audience are italians, lovers of italian food, and amateur cooks who want/need a place to store recipes
* the look needs to speak and feel italian
* needs to have an option to create, edit and update, as well as delete recipes
* needs to have a page where you can see all the recipes
* needs to be able to search for recipes.

### User stories

As a general user, 
* I want the page to be simple and easy to use

As an existing chef/amateur cook, I want 
* to immediately think of Italy
* the page to feel and look like a cooking website
* to share and upload recipes option
* to be able to edit any recipes if I make a mistake
* to have an app to store my recipes and make it easy to find them

As a potential user and fan of Italian food, I want 
* to find and view new recipes to try
* to be able to add recipes if i want to
